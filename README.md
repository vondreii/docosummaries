# new-docusummaries

## About 

This is the codebase to [https://docosummaries.netlify.app/](https://docosummaries.netlify.app/).

Docosummaries is a place where you can learn about new documentaries, read plot summaries of documentaries, and find links where you could watch the documentaries for free online.

Functionalities include:
- A searchbar to search for categories, tags, or documentaries.
- A dynamic sidebar to filter documentaries based on what you select.
- Youtube embeds so you can watch it directly from the site, next to the summary.

Known Issues:
- Sidebar that is expanded will collapse on page refresh 

This is still currently in its very early stages of development.
