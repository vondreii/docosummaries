On February 2, 1989, in Helena, Montana, United States, 48 cars of a Montana Rail Link freight train had been decoupled from their locomotives by a train crew on Mullan Pass.

The carriages then rolled backwards towards the city of Helena. The runaway train collided with a work train at a railway crossing near the center of the community, creating explosions and resulting fires.

The train crew were driving up a rural area when they encountered some electrical issues. They parked the train at a siding, and decoupled the 48 of the carriages. They did not put the hand brakes on the cars, only the air brakes. Because of the freezing temperatures, the air brakes started to fail, causing the carriages to start rolling backwards down the hill. 

There were possible toxic chemicals on board the train, so most of the town was evacuated temporarily. No one died.
