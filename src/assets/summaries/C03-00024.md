The documentary film gives graphical representations of the dam's location and the path of the destruction caused during the Vajont Dam collapse. The dam was built next to Monte Toc, which was geologically unstable. Cracks were noticed while building a new road on the side of Monte Toc.

[Vajont Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajont_Dam)

The Vajont Dam is a Dam located in Northern Italy. Despite many warnings and a landslide that caused a wave 12m high (and killing one person), construction of the damn continued. Construction was completed in 1959, and in 1960 the dam basin started getting filled. 

On 9 October 1963, during initial filling, a massive landslide from the side of the Mount Toc fell into the basin, caused water to overflow in the damn. The resulting large waves topped over the damn and into several villages and towns below.

This destroyed the villages of Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova and Fa√®, killing around 2,000 people and turning the land below the dam into a flat plain of mud. Many small villages nearby also suffered damage. In Longarone, out of 372 buildings, only 22 were still standing. The event claimed almost 2000 lives, making it one of the worst disasters in history.
