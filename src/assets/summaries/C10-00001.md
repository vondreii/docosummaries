Ellen is a famous talkshow host and always ends her show by encouraging the audience to always be kind. Allegations were revealed that the way she acted behind the scenes was completely opposite to the messages she encouraged on her show.

Many allegations came out recently (2020) from her ex-staff members and current staff members claiming that she was hostile to some people and the work environment behind-the-scenes of the Ellen talk show was very toxic.

Allegations include:

- Almost getting a women fired because her nail polish was chipped
- No one was allowed to make eye contact with her. She fired someone with autism because they did that
- Steaks were being grilled for a BBQ but she was extremely picky and demanded they stopped because she hated meat
- People walking past Ellen in the hallway said she looked away and never greeted them
