JFK was riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza. He was riding next to his wife. Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting.

It was suspected that Former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin. However, this is speculated and a major conspiracy. He was caught so quickly, and he was also assassinated himself, by Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit. It is possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was framed for the murder.

Some witnesses heard multiple shots in multiple directions, resulting in the 2-shooter conspiracy theory. The video of the shooting also show the driver (or the person next to the driver, in the front seat) turn around and pull out something in the seconds that JFK was shot (another conspiracy theory). There is also the 'single bullet theory' that tries to explain how one bullet can enter so many places (because the Texas Governor was also shot).
