This was the worst commercial plane accident in history as of writing this, 2 planes (a KLM and a Pan Am flight) collided at the Tenerife airport runway. 

[Tenerife Airport Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_airport_disaster)

Tenerife was a small airport and many flights were directed there after a terrorist threat/incident at another main airport, so flights were delayed when trying to take off the small single runway. It was also very misty on that day with little visibility. 

The KLM was waiting at the end of the runway waiting to take off. The Pan Am was still taxi-ing down the runway, towards the KLM but was meant to take one of the exits. The KLM did not recieve the clearance to fly, but the captain was impatient since he had already been waiting for many hours at the airport (because of the delays). The captain just decided to take off but the Pan Am had not cleared the runway yet.

The KLM smashed directly into the Pan Am at full speed killing 583 people.
