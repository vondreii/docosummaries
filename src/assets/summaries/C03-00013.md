Japan Flight 123 was travelling from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Osaka International Airport, Japan. A massive decompression caused the airplane to crash in the nearby mountains only 12 minutes after take off. The crash was so bad that most people were dismembered. 520/524 people died. It is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in aviation history.

7 years before the crash, the aircraft was involved in a tailstrike incident at Osaka International Airport, which damaged the aircraft's pressure bulkhead. The pressure bulkhead was not repaired properly, and this fell through safety checks.

Everytime the cabin/plane needs to be pressurised for humans, parts of the aircraft like the wings are stressed, and causes a certain level of fatigue. Overtime it wears the aircraft out and this determines the life of the aircraft. Because of the way they did the repair, fatigue cracking was bound to happen earlier. 

Eventually, after 7 years, the pressurisation system failed and decompression happened within the cabin, causing some of the roof to cave in during mid-flight. Pilots turned around to make an emergency landing. However it was very difficult to control the aircraft and they started getting disoriented. They flew for 32 minutes attempting to gain control, but eventually crashed in a mountain region known as 'Tibet.'

The Rescue efforts were delayed due to the difficult mountain location, and that it was starting to get difficult to spot the aircraft as it was now nightfall. Rescue people saw the crash and reported that there were no signs of survivors, and waited until the next morning. 

It was found that 4 people survived. One of the survivors recounted that many people did survive, they were screaming and moaning in pain throughout the night, but they all slowly stopped as they died. If rescue had been immediate, many more people would have been saved.
