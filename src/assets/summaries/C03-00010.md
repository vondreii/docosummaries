The train was running from Kaprun to the Kitzsteinhorn. It went up to the top of the ski resort, then back down to the bottom. To get to the top of the ski resort, the train had to go on an upwards trajectory and through a tunnel. 

The train was driverless, they just had an attendent who only openned the doors.

shortly after 9:00 a.m., the electric fan heater in the unattended cabin at the lower end of the train caught fire, officially due to a design flaw that caused the unit to overheat. The fire then spread throughout the train quickly because of flammable hydraulic fluid from the brake system. 

The train stopped in the middle of the tunnel, with all the passengers trapped inside. The doors did not open, even the operator and the people tried their best to open them. Twelve people from the rear of the train, successfully broke a window with a ski pole and were able to escape.

The other 155 people were trapped and either suffocated or burned to death.
