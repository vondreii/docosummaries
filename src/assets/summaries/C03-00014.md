In July of 1945 a B-25 Mitchell bomber of the United States Army Air Forces crashed into the Empire State Building in New York City, while flying in thick fog. 14 people died.

Lieutenant Colonel William F. Smith Jr was piloting the plane. He asked to land, but was declined because of the thick smoke and lack of visibility. 

He didn't follow the instructions and decreased his altitude to attempt to land anyway. Because he couldn't see, he took wrong turns and ended up crashing into the Empire State building. It crashed between the 78th and 80th floors, making a large hole through the building. Despite this, the structure itself was strong and was not damaged, so the building could continue to operate (and still operates to this day).

Betty Lou Oliver was an elevator operator who had sever burns because of the crash.

> First aid workers placed her on another elevator car to transport her to the ground floor, but the cables supporting that car had been damaged in the incident, and the car fell 75 stories, ending up in the basement.[9] Oliver survived the fall but had a broken pelvis, back and neck when rescuers found her amongst the rubble.[10] This remains the world record for the longest survived elevator fall.
