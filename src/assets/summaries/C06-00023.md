Micheal Robert Ryan was unemployed and living with his mother. The motive is still unclear, though it is possible he was suffering from mental issues.

Micheal Robert Ryan started the massacre by shooting random people in his neighbourhood in Hungerford. Ryan shot at windows and at people who appeared on the street. He walked towards the town's common, shooting more people and families. He also set the family home (where he lived with his mother) on fire.

His mother came home (possibly from a job interview) and was confonted by the burning house, and people dying and dead on the street infront of it. She saw her son armed with a gun, and tried to reason with him, but he shot her many times.

Micheal  then went back to the town's common, shooting more people. At some point he broke into the John O'Gaunt Community Technology College, which is where he studied. It was closed as it was the summer break.

Micheal barricaded himself in one of the classrooms. Police tried to reason with him, where he admitted that his mother's death was a mistake. He finally shot himself.
