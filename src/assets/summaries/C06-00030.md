Grégory Villemin (24 August 1980 – 16 October 1984) was abducted from his home and murdered at the age of four. This became a well known case in France. The murder remains unsolved.

Before the abduction, Grégory's parents and grand parents receieved phone/letter threats. The man who was making threats may have know or done business with the family at some point, and wanted revenge for something (we don't know why).

 One day, Grégory was playing in the front yard. All of a sudden, he disappeared. The parents reported him as a missing person. Half an hour later, the family received a phone call from the guy who was threatening them previously, saying he had taken Grégory and threw him into a nearby pond. 

That same night, authorities found him in that same pond, hands and feet tied up.
