On the 4th of October 1992, El Al Flight 1862 crashed into an apartment complex in the Netherlands, killing 43 people. The exact number of people killed on the ground is disputed, as the building housed many undocumented immigrants.

The plane went right throught the apartment complex, splitting it in half, and destroying all apartments at the point of impact. 

During the flight from New York to Schiphol, three issues were noted: fluctuations in the autopilot speed regulation, problems with a radio, and fluctuations in the voltage of the electrical generator on engine number three, the inboard engine on the right wing that would later detach from the aircraft and initiate the accident.

One couple decided to go and visit someone else (5 minutes away), leaving their son inside their apartment. They saw or heard the plane crash, and immediately went to run back to their apartment. When they opened the door, there was nothing but a pit/hole where you could see the debris below (meaning, their apartment had been completely wiped out, it was part of the giant hole that was made).
