The captain was Francesco Schettino. 32 people died.

The captain wanted to do a 'salute' along the coastline, but it went too close and hit some rocks, creating a hole. 

There was no communication between the staff and the passengers. The passengers were told that there was nothing wrong, only last minute they were told to evacuate but the ship was already in the middle of sinking. 

The captain, Francesco Schettino, was one of the first to leave the ship, leaving about 300 passengers behind. They had to be rescued via helicopters or rescue boats. 

Francesco Schettino was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to sixteen years in prison.
