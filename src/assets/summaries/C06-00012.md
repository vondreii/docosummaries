It took them multiple months (probably up to a year) to plan the attack. They created many home made bombs hidden throughout their rooms and regularly went to practice shooting in the woods. They also kept written evidence, journal entries, and video recordings of their plans. It was extremely comprehensive and a lot of thought was put into planning the massacre. Their parents didn't seem to keep an eye on their activities since a room search would have uncovered many things they were hiding. 

They planted a bomb in the cafeteria, and the original plan was that it would detonate around lunch time while everyone was in the cafeteria. As people were running out they would shoot as many as they could. 

However the bomb did not go off and so they just started shooting as they walked into the building. They made their way to the library where the majority of the killings happened. They shot many people in the head.

After being in the library for some time they walked out into the hallway and walked around, shooting more people they passed.

The finally went back the library for a second time, had a shootout with police through the window, before finally shooting themselves.
