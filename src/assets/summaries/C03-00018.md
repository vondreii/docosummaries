In 1937, a natural gas leak caused an explosion which destroyed the London School of New London, Texas. 295 students and teachers were killed.

The school had many gas heaters throughout the building. A gas line was faulty, allowing untreated natural gas (which was odorless and colorless) to leak throughout the hallways and crawlspaces of the school. Students frequently complained of headaches but no action was taken.

On Thursday, March 18, a labourer turned on an electric sander (for sanding or making surfaces smooth). The electricity or power sparked, and a fire ignited with the gas in the air, causing a sudden explosion.

Of the more than 600 people in the school, only about 130 escaped without serious injury. Most of the bodies were either burned beyond recognition, or blown to pieces, so even though estimates are around 295 it is very possible that the number of dead are higher. 

Since then, a chemical called thiols (mercaptans) has been added to natural gas so that leaks are now easily detectable.
