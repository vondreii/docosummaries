In 2016, an incident at the Thunder River Rapids killed 4 people while they were on the park's ride. 2 people (the children of the family) survived.

At Dreamworld, Gold Coast, there is a Thunder River Rapids ride, where people get on boats and ride a directed path full of small waves (to simulate canoeing). 

A failure in the pumps resulted in too low water levels, so one of the rafts got stuck in the middle. Another raft, that was travelling towards it, collided with the stuck raft. This caused the raft to flip vertically, and the occupants fell out and into the machinery and were pulverised by the conveyer belt below.

The park was then shutdown temporarily while investigations took place.
