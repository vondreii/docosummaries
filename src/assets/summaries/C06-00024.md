The Olympic athletes were in their apartment/accomodation. At 4:30 am local time on 5 September, as the athletes slept, 8 terrorists (wearing ski masks and holding AK rifles). 2 people were killed in the initial invasion of the accomodation. 

The terrorists were led by Luttif Afif. Shortly after the hostages were taken, Afif demanded the release of 234 Palestinian prisoners in Israel jails and other important people.

The hostages along with the terrorists were transported to the airport. The terrorists were trying to negotiate a way out though plane, however the police saw this as an opportunity to ambush them. Do to poor communication, 'half' the team aborting the mission without telling the others, and missed sniper rifle attempts, a fight and shootout started between terrorists and police. The terrorists turned their guns to the hostages and shot them all dead. He then pulled out a hand grenade which exploded. Most of the hostages were burnt beyond recognition due to the explosion. 

Reports falsely stated that only the terrorists were killed, and that the hostages were saved. This gave false hope to families for a while. Only later it was found out that they were all killed - all hostages, all terrorists.
