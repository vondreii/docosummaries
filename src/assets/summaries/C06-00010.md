Belle Gibson was an Australian author and health advocate. She sold products such as the 'The Whole Pantry' and many people looked up to her as an inspiration. It turns out she was faking all her illnesses.

Belle Gibson lied about:

- Having Brain, Blood, Spleen, Uterine, Liver and Kidney Cancers
- Having Heart Surgery 3 times
- Dying on the operating table
- Having A stroke
- Her Age ("I believe I am 23 years old").

She said she was not doing traditional treatments for her illness, instead she was healing herself naturally with diet and exercise and 'alternative therapies' which usually would not work in reality.

"Gibson also promoted more controversial or potentially dangerous alternative medical practices, including Gerson therapy, anti-vaccination, and the consumption of non-pasteurised raw milk."
