Amanda claimed she had been at her boyfriend's (Raffaele Sollecito) house the night of the murder. She came home the next morning, and saw Meredith's door locked with blood all over the bathroom, so she called the police.

Both Amanda and Raffaele gave inconsistent stories that constantly changed. Amanda made false statements about many people, including the police and Meredith, discrediting herself.

When the police found Merideth, Amanda and Raffaele were very inappropriately kissing and making out at the crime scene.

They were found guilty, and sentenced to 25 to 26 years. However, Amanda spent 4 years in prison and her appeal was approved. Raffaele's DNA was found on Meredith's clothing, and the DNA of another man was also found, and he was also convicted of the attack.

Amanda tried to frame her boss for the murder, but he was released.
