A United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft flew too low and cut a cable car rope supporting a cable car full of tourists. 20 people died.

The plane was flying as part of some sort of training exercise. The crew in the cockpit were reportedly 'showing off.' They were also reportedly filming or recording their tricks and reckless behaviour as they were flying low through the mountains. They were flying at an altitude of between 260 and 330 feet (80 and 100 m) in a narrow valley between the mountains. The cable was cut at a height of 360 feet (110 m).

The aircraft's right wing struck the cables from underneath. The crew felt 'bumps' or 'bangs' but were not really affected. The plane went back to base safely, whereas the cable car fell immediately, killing all 20 people onboard on impact. The crew deleted or destroyed the recordings of them in the cockpit (which was suspicious). They were charged with involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide but this was dropped, then retrialed. So many errors were discovered on the pilot and crew's part.
