When Luka Magnotta was younger, he used to work as a stripper and escort. He had a history of credit card fraud, impersonating another person's identity, and bankruptcy.  

In 2010 a video was released online called '1 boy 2 kittens.' The video featured a male in a hooded jacket, vacuum sealing two kittens until they suffocated and died. People online were outraged and made a collective effort to find Luka. They looked at plug sockets on the wall of the video to narrow down the killerâ€™s location. They listened to background sounds to determine the languages heard.

In 2011, 2 more kitten videos were released, 'Bathtime LOL' (with a kitten being drowned taped to a broomstick) and 'Python Christmas' (a kitten being fed to a snake while alive). People started speculating it was only a matter of time before he started killing people instead of animals.

In 2012 he uploaded '1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick' where he killed a young man (Jun Lin who was studying Computer Science at the time), decapitated and dismembered him and mailed parts of him across Montreal.
