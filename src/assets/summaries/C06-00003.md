Belinda is the sister of the serial killer Mark Van Krevel:

[Mark Valera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Valera)

Mark was convicted in 2000 of 2 separate murders, David O'Hearn and Frank Arkell in Wollongong, New South Wales, when he was 19 years old. He smashed both their heads in and cut off the head of one of them. He was also linked to a third murder as well where the victim was almost dismembered.

Belinda is the sister of Mark, and she claimed that when they were growing up they were severely abused by their dad who 'raped' Mark several times. Belinda blamed him for all the bad things Mark did.

Belinda hired someone to kill their dad, and she whole heartedly still believes to this day that he deserved it. She spent time in prison for it but was released. 

She was then convicted of stabbing one of her boyfriends. She claimed that she did not remember the incident. According to the boyfriend, she was screaming her dad's name while she was stabbing him. Since she was intoxicated at the time it was thought that she had entered a psychotic episode. She spent time in prison for that too.

She is now out and free and admitting that she wants another chance of a normal life, and that she is not evil.
